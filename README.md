# RaspberryPi-Webcontroll: Effortless Control via Wi-Fi

Take command of your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W through the power of your web browser! This project empowers you to configure and control your Pi remotely, leveraging the built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Whether you're using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a different Wi-Fi-enabled Raspberry Pi model, or even a Linux-based system with Wi-Fi (Debian-based preferred), RaspberryPi-Webcontroll provides a convenient and flexible solution.

## Requirements:

- Raspberry Pi:
  - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (recommended)
  - Other Raspberry Pi models with Wi-Fi capabilities
- Or, a Linux-based system with Wi-Fi (Debian-based preferred)

## Getting Started (Simple Steps):

1. **Download the Latest Release:**
   - Head over to the project's releases section to grab the latest ZIP file containing the `web_control` directory and its dependencies.

2. **Unpack and Navigate:**
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location on your Raspberry Pi. Open a terminal window and navigate to the unzipped `web_control` directory using the `cd` command.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Some additional software components are required for RaspberryPi-Webcontroll to function. To install them, run the following command in your terminal (you might need root privileges):

     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Start the Web Server:**
   - With the dependencies in place, it's time to launch the web server! Execute the following command in your terminal from within the `web_control` directory:

     ```
     ./app.py
     ```

   This will start the web server, allowing you to access the control interface remotely.

5. **Optional: Automatic Startup (Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W):**
   - To automatically start the web server whenever your Raspberry Pi boots (this functionality might not be available on all Raspberry Pi models), you can use the cron job functionality. Refer to the project documentation for detailed instructions on configuring automatic startup.

## Accessing the Web Interface:

- Once the web server is running, you can access the control interface from any device on your network by opening a web browser and navigating to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi followed by the default port (usually 80). For example, if your Pi's IP address is `192.168.1.100`, you would visit [http://192.168.1.100/](http://192.168.1.100/). The exact port number might be different; refer to the project documentation for more details.

## Remember:

- For detailed instructions, advanced configuration options, and troubleshooting guidance, kindly refer to the project's comprehensive documentation (link to be provided).
- Secure your Raspberry Pi by setting a strong password for the web interface.

With RaspberryPi-Webcontroll, managing your Raspberry Pi becomes a breeze!
